# Frontend Challenge: Company Filter and Sort App
This is a simple web application that fetches a list of companies from an API and allows users to filter them by country and industry, as well as sort by name or number of employees.
The app is built with plain HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating skills in DOM manipulation, asynchronous data fetching, and UI accessibility.
